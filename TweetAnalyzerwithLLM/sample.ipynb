Although not a direct distress call like \\\"I'm trapped\\\", it's a serious escalating situation requiring prompt attention. It is not just general information. Therefore, Priority should be 2.  It is not priority 1 because there is no explicit call for rescue and no mention of anyone being directly trapped. It's more severe than priority 3 as it seems to be a significant fire in a populated area.\n",
